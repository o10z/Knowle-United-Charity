          <strong>Relief of Need:</strong> Applications for a grant will be
          considered by the Trustees from eligible individuals who may be
          suffering exceptional need or hardship and grants may be given to
          assist with a specific need. If you, or some-one you know, has a

          Grants may also be given to individuals or organisations which provide
          benefit or support to vulnerable groups of people who reside within
          the Charity’s specified areas. During the recent Covid restrictions
          significant grants totalling £120.000 over two years were made to
          schools within our prescribed areas to support additional needs of
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groups which the Charity has supported include equipment for local
          Church youth groups, playgroups, children’s play areas, scouts and
          sheltered accommodation improvements and many more. The Charity
          prefers applications for a specific item or part of a project.
          Supporting documentation will be required with the application form
          which should be sent to the Clerk.
