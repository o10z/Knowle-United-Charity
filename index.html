      <h2>About Knowle United Charity</h2>
      <p>
        Knowle United Charity traces its origins back to the 17th Century and
        over the last 300 years the Charity has been providing benefits to
        people in the ancient ecclesiastical parishes of St. John the Baptist,
        Knowle; St. Philip’s, Dorridge; St. Swithin’s, Barston and the civil
        parishes of Balsall Common & Chadwick End. The Charity’s governing
        document, which is registered with the Charity Commission, specifies
        that any grants made by the Charity are limited to benefit residents
        within these areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowle United Charity owns 22 properties of various types and sizes in
        the village of Knowle and these are rented to people of limited means
        who have a close connection to Knowle at the time of their application.
        The Charity does not retain a waiting list and vacancies are advertised
        locally when any property becomes available. There is no warden or other
        support provided by the Charity.
      </p>
