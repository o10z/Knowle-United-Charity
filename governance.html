              Knowle United Charity is managed by 12 Trustees and their Clerk,
              Simon Chaloner, who carries out the day to day business and
              management of the properties. The activities of the Charity are
              determined by the Governing document, the Constitution, and the
              Trustees have a duty to ensure that the Charity functions in
              accordance with the Constitution.
            </li>

            <li>
              The Trustees meetings are held in March, July and November each
              year and members of the Property Sub-Committee and the Clerkâ€™s
              Sub-Committee also meet whenever necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Charity owns the land on which Knowle Church of England
              Primary Academy junior school is built and has for many years made
              grants to the school under the former Knowle Educational Charity.
            </li>
            <li>
              From the income the Charity receives from its properties and
              investments, the Trustees make various grants to local residents
              and groups for the relief of need and for the promotion of
              education in the area. The Charity annual accounts and reports are
              available on the Charity Commission website.
